The explosive materials are carefully stowed and concealed in a way that makes it difficult for security personnel to detect them using standard security procedures. The bombs might be set to explode upon a specific trigger or if any particular movement occurs that activates the hidden mechanism. This kind of attack highlights the importance of thorough security measures and vigilance to prevent such incidents from occurring. The individuals involved in such an attack may face serious consequences for their actions, including criminal charges and potential life imprisonment."}
